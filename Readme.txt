Epicode School - Week 7 Project: 

Tracks: Use a fetch call to get data and print them to an application (Vanilla JavaScript).

When the document loads, 2 sample cards will be generated, with a button to delete the last card created, and a button that generate an empty card with input that can be populated with text to create your own card.
